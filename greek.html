<h4>The Creation of Zeus</h4>
  <p>Zeus is the Olympian god of the sky and the thunder, the king of all other gods and men, and, consequently, the chief figure in Greek mythology. The son of Cronus and Rhea, he is probably most famous for his infidelity to his sister and wife, Hera.  Athena, Apollo and Artemis, Hermes, Dionysus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, and the Muses are all children of his numerous affairs. Hephaestus, Hebe, and Ares are his legitimate children. Zeus’ name is thought to have originated from the Ancient Greek word for “bright.” The word has a close connection with dies, which is the Latin word for “day” and has a very ancient history. Therefore, many mythologists believe that Zeus is one of the oldest Greek gods.Usually, Zeus is portrayed with a scepter in one hand and a thunderbolt in the other – both symbols of his authority. Sometimes he wears a crown of oak leaves – the oak was deemed to be his sacred tree. Homer repeatedly describes him as “aegis-bearing”: the Aegis was an enormous shield which Zeus frequently carried with him, lending it to his daughter Athena from time to time. In addition, he owns a pet: a giant golden eagle called Aetos Dios.
Zeus was raised by Gaia, Adamanthea, and a goat named Amalthea after his mother saved his life and sent him away to protect him.
Zeus' siblings were Hades, Poseidon, Demeter, Hera and Hestia.
Zeus' parents Rhea and Cronus were human-shaped giants called Titans.
Zeus' weapon was a thunderbolt that he could throw at anything or anyone when he wished.
Zeus' symbols were the thunderbolt, eagle, bull and the oak.
He was one of six children, and later married his sister Hera.
When Zeus and his brothers overthrew Cronus, they each became rulers. Zeus became the ruler of the sky and air; Hades became ruler of the dead; Poseidon became ruler of water.
Zeus married his sister Hera but also had children with many other women.
His children with Hera were Ares (the god of war), Hebe and Eileithyia (the goddess of childbirth).
Zeus lived on Mount Olympus and ruled the gods of Olympus and mortal men.
Zeus had the ability to mimic people's voices.
Zeus was able to shape shift, which means he was able to transform himself to look like an animal or another person.
When angered, Zeus could turn a person into an animal.
Zeus' horse was called Pegasus. Pegasus carried his thunderbolts. Zeus taught an eagle to retrieve the thunderbolts after he had thrown them.
Jupiter is the Roman equivalent of Zeus.
The ancient Olympics were held each year to honor Zeus.
Zeus' powerful shield was called the Aegis.
Zeus believed in the importance of keeping one's word and would punish anyone who lied or deceived others in business.
Zeus is believed to have been married three times. His wives were Metis, Themis, and Hera.
Zeus was also father to Ares, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Dionysus, Hebe, Hermes, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Hephaestus, Perseus, Minos, the Muses, and the Graces.
Although Zeus lived on Mount Olympus he liked to visit earth. He had many children who had mortal mothers and him as their father.
Zeus was immortal but had the ability to affect the lives of mortal people.
Zeus had twin children named Apollo and Artemis with Leto.
Zeus had a child with his sister Demeter named Persephone.
